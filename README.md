# Guess-the-number
Guess the Number is a simple game where the computer generates a random number between a specified range and the player tries to guess the number. The objective of the game is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.

In this Python implementation of the game, the computer will generate a random number between a specified minimum and maximum range, and the player will have to guess the number through the command line interface. The game will provide feedback to the player after each guess, letting them know if their guess was too high or too low.

The player will have a specified number of guesses to try and correctly guess the number, and the game will end when the player either correctly guesses the number or runs out of guesses.

To play the game, the player will simply need to run the Python script and follow the prompts to enter their guesses. The game will provide feedback after each guess and inform the player if they have correctly guessed the number or if they need to try again.

This game can be a fun way to practice basic programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, and user input/output, while also providing a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.
